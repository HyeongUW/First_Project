# Movie/Streaming - Search

Movie/Streaming search Web Page

## Description

This web application helps a user search for Movie/Streaming content to view.
It consists of a Landing page with top Box office and trending movies, a search page and a detail page.
Clicking on a movie within either the landing page or the search page results will bring that title up in the detail page.

The Landing page will likely have scrolling entries of top Box office and trending titles by genre.
The Search page will allow for searching by one or more critiera.

The detail page should have all things about the title and where the title can be streamed.

Nice to have features could include
1.  detail cast information
2.  reviews
3.  saved watch later list
4.  personal preferences leveraged for suggestions on the landing page
